ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LastElectron

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Mechanical Engineer currently pursuing an M.Tech with a passion for navigating the chaos of machines and code. Iâ€™m exploring the realms of **Python, MATLAB**, and **Abaqus** with enthusiasm and a focus on mechanical engineering, modelling and computational analysis.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into [e.g., developing simulation models using python scripts in Abaqus, optimizing algorithms].

ðŸ’¬ "Logical jugaad is innovation."

âœ¨ Fueled by **Shiny Object Syndrome**, but always back to my goals.
